# machine_learning_basic
Python codes for Makoto Ito's **"Textbooks of Machine Learning Learning with Python (Korean Edition)".**  
It starts from **Chapter5** -Supervised learning: Regression.  
Since I am studying machine learning with this book, other chapters will be uploaded as soon as I completed them.  

I added some descriptions to help understanding.  
Some parts of the codes could be different from the original one in the book.
