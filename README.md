# machine_learning_basic
Python codes from Makoto Ito's *"Textbooks of Machine Learning Learning with Python (Korean Edition)".*
It starts from Chapter5 - Supervised learning: Regression.
Uploading is on going, and other chapters will be uploaded soon.

I added some descriptions to help understanding.
Some parts of the codes could be different from the original one in the book.
